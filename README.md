# No-Annoying-Stuff
## What?
This texture pack basically removes rain, pumpkin blur, sun, moon, snow and vignette. Just the regular annoying stuff.
An issue I found is that since the rain is totally removed, that means it can be hard to indicate if it is raining which could end up confusing you. Same goes for snow.
The sun and moon has been removed just because I don't like it and I feel like it's an annoying feature.
That's really all there is to this texture pack.
No images are required as the descriptions above has listed the features removed.
